	SORTING ALGORITMS AND THE BIG O NOTATION


Sorting are a set of procedures or methods used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order.

These algorithms take a collection of items as input and rearrange them in a specific order according to some defined criteria.

Big O notation, also known as asymptotic notation, is a mathematical notation used to describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm.

provides a way to analyze the performance of an algorithm by expressing the upper bound of its running time or space requirements as a function of the input size

The relationship between sorting algorithms and big O notation lies in understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms.

Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size.


Big O notation is commonly used to express the worst-case time complexity of sorting algorithms.


EXAMPLE
-------

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

Here's an example implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Python:


		def bubble_sort(arr):
			n = len(arr)
			for i in range(n):
				# Last i elements are already in place
				for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
					# Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
					if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
					arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
			return arr


This project aims to dive deeper into different sorting algorithms and the different time complexities in each

The code will be implemented in c prigramming language
